                  <p class="text">I've been studing programming for few months ago,
                    I studied python but i stopped because i didn't have the the
                    necessary requirements (I was studying on my dump phone, Even
                    sometimes i wan writing codes on paper) now i decedied to study

                    theft auto (GTA) 5 and resantly fortnite, It's a good source
                    of entrtainment just don't waste a lot of time on it, I love

                  <p class="text">Any one who says "I don't care about money."-
                    Their fucking lying, It's not a bad thing to love money and
                    as zig zigler said "Money is not the most imortant thing in
                    life, But it ranks right up there with oxygen." For me my
                    beggest dream in life is to become a millionaire, I hope you
                    also become a millionaire.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                  <h2>Why i hate school</h2>
                  <p class="text">School system is basically stupid, groupping in
                    a place they hate wihtout knowing why and teaching them subjecs
                    they don't like and won't use in their entire lives and wasting
                    12 years of their lives, Specialy nowdays there are literally
                    thousends of sources in different fields that are really "HELPFULL"
                    and might become a future cereer that pays off.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                  <h2>Books</h2>
                  <p class="text">I started reading books four months ago, it's
                    one of the best decision in my life, books help you grow and
                    become a better person, (alhamdulillah) Books have changed me
                    and made me a better personal, because really i was such a "nowry"
                    before it, So far i've read 24 books in an average of one book a week
                    and i'm looking forwerd to increasing it, My faviourt auther is robert
                    greene, Two of my faviourt books of all time are atomic habits, And
                    48 laws of power (I recommend you reading them). </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                  <h2>Self-education</h2>
                  <p class="text">As i said i hate school as i explained earlier
                  and i suggested a solution which is "SELF-EDUCATION", Nowdays
                  knowledge is not exclusive for schools or colleges or academic
                  centers in general, You literally have all the world knowledge
                  in your pocket, You can learn and study any subjec you want
                  on the internet, For me i studied english in school for 9
                  years but couldn't hold a conversation, I studied in home for
                  2 years and i'm ALMOST fluent, And now i'm studying spanish,
                  Web development, Digital markerting, Math, Reading books,
                  Reading quran, And studying engilsh all by myself at home,
                  So why the fuck! should i go to school.</p>
